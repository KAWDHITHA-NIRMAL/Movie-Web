## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a Firebase project and configure its services.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd movie-night
    \`\`\`
2.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project.
    *   Add a web app to your Firebase project.
    *   Copy your Firebase configuration object (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
    *   Update the `firebaseConfig` object in `login.html`, `register.html`, and `index.html`, and `room.html` with your project's details.
    *   **Enable Firebase services:**
        *   **Authentication:** Go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable "Email/Password".
        *   **Firestore Database:** Create a Firestore database in "production mode".
        *   **Realtime Database:** Create a Realtime Database.
    *   **Deploy Firestore Security Rules:** Copy the content from `firestore.rules` into your Firestore "Rules" tab and publish.
    *   **Deploy Realtime Database Rules:** Copy the content from `database.rules.json` into your Realtime Database "Rules" tab and publish.
    *   **Create Firestore Composite Index:** For the "My Rooms" section to load efficiently, you might need a composite index for `rooms` collection on `creator.uid` (Ascending) and `createdAt` (Descending). Firebase will usually suggest this in the console if needed.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a client-side application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can simply open the `login.html` file in your web browser. For a more robust local development experience, you can use a simple local web server (e.g., `npx serve` or Python's `http.server`).

    \`\`\`bash
    # Using npx serve (if you have Node.js installed)
    npx serve .
    \`\`\`
    Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/login.html` (or the port `serve` indicates).
